# Project Title: SVM Classification and Hyperparameter Tuning with Synthetic Data

## Overview

This project demonstrates the process of creating a synthetic dataset, training a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, evaluating its performance, and optimizing its hyperparameters using grid search. The goal is to provide a comprehensive example of how to implement SVM for classification tasks and tune its parameters to achieve the best performance.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can install the required packages using the following command:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Data preparation: The notebook generates a synthetic dataset using `make_classification` from `sklearn.datasets`

2. Running the notebook: Open the `notebook.ipynb`


## Steps in the Notebook:
1. Import Libraries:

Import necessary libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`, and `scikit-learn`.

2. Create Synthetic Dataset:

Generate a synthetic dataset using `make_classification` from `sklearn.datasets`.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets using `train_test_split`.

3. Visualize Data:

Use `seaborn` to visualize the synthetic dataset.

4. Classification with SVM:

Train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier on the training data.
Predict on the test data.

5. Evaluate Model:

Print the classification report and confusion matrix to evaluate the model's performance.

6. Hyperparameter Tuning:

Perform hyperparameter tuning using `GridSearchCV` to find the best parameters for the SVM model.
Print the best parameters and the corresponding performance metrics.
